  <h2>Final Step: Close the Case</h2>
  <br>
  <p>When a case is closed in the real EPIC system, a few important things happen to keep everything transparent and accountable.</p>
  <br>
  <p>First, your <strong>Unit Head</strong> gets an automatic email that includes:</p>
    <li>The incident summary</li>
    <li>The case notes recorded from start to finish</li>
    <li>Direct links to approve or reject the closure from the email</li>
  <br>
  <p>At the same time, the closure request gets added to the <strong>Cases to Close</strong> queue in EPIC — just like it does now. That queue lets Unit Heads track and manage closure approvals directly from the system.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In this updated version, the <strong>Cases to Close</strong> will also highlight and record how long cases have been sitting with Unit Heads awaiting closure. That way, accountability is shared — not just with officers, but also with leaders who approve final outcomes.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This step helps maintain a clear record of how each case was resolved and makes sure everyone’s in sync before the case officially wraps up.</p>
