    <h1>This is how you edit the location</h1>
    <p>There should be radio buttons to choose whether you adjust the location via typing the address, or input via the map.<br><br>
        If you choose the map, it should open a map interface where you can drag a pin to the desired location.<br>
        If you choose the address, it should allow you to type in the address and then click a button to update the map with that address.<br><br>
        Once you have selected the location and hit save, should update the case with the new location.
