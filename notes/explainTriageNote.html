  <h2>About Regulatory Triage</h2><br>
  <p>
    This triage function comes from the OLT and will replace the existing case classification section.<br><br>
    It’s easier to use — just two fields: *Likelihood* and *Consequence*. These combine into a **primary risk score** which sets the case due date automatically.<br><br>
    No need to calculate anything yourself — just use your judgment to guide the priority.
