  <h2>About Regulatory Triage</h2><br>
  <p>
    The regulatory triage system starts by scoring the *Likelihood* and *Consequence* of environmental or health risks.
    These are multiplied to give a **primary risk score**.<br><br>

    If this score is **11 or more**, it indicates a higher level of risk. At this point, additional factors should be considered:
      <li>How often this type of issue occurs (Frequency)</li>
      <li>How sensitive the receiving environment is</li>
      <li>Whether the public is concerned about it</li>
      <li>The compliance history of the person or business involved</li>

    You donâ€™t need to score these, just use your judgment to help guide decisions about follow-up and priority.
