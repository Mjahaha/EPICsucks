  <h2>Why There Are Fewer Fields in This Section</h2><br>
  <p>In this redesigned EPIC layout, the <strong>Details</strong> section has been simplified to focus only on what’s essential. Here’s why:</p><br>

    <li><strong>Receiving Officer</strong> is now <em>auto-populated</em> based on how the case was received and who made it. If EnviroLine creates the case, it’ll show as through EnviroLine. If an officer enters it, their name is recorded. Same goes for after-hours entries. There should of course be an opportunity to override this if necessary. This will now be visible in the Case Summary tab instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Source of Notification</strong> has been removed. This info should already be captured naturally in the <em>Incident Description</em> if it’s relevant or non-standard.</li>
    <li><strong>Legislation</strong> field has been removed — it wasn’t adding value to the case record.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident Start Date</strong> is replaced with <strong>Date Discovered</strong>. In most cases, reporters don’t know when the issue started, but they always know when they became aware of the incident.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident End Date</strong> has been removed. It’s rarely known and, if relevant, time periods should be explained in the <em>Incident Description</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>After Hours Incident Number</strong> will now only appear <em>if</em> the case came in after hours. Otherwise, it stays hidden to avoid clutter.</li>
    <br>
  <p>Other details, like how the case came in and background info, are now displayed on the <strong>Case Summary</strong> page instead — keeping this screen clean and focused for investigation.</p>
