    <h2>Relate cases to one another (Not notifications)</h2>
    <p>
        To streamline the workflow, improve record keeping, and make reporting and development easier, cases will be related to each rather
        than duplicating records as cases from notifications. <b>The notification stage of cases should be removed entirely.</b>
