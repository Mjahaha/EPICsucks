  <h1>Welcome to EPIC Ops Redo</h1>
  <p><strong>EPIC Ops Redo</strong> is a prototype of EPIC, designed to communicate a fresh, streamlined layout.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The purpose of this (and all) high-fidelity prototypes is to focus on layout, flow, and user interaction. The underlying system has not been rebuilt — so this version can’t save data or connect to real systems.</p>
  <br>
    <li>Case management from receiving a case to closure (but not creation).</li>
    <li>Home screens (My Work and Dashboard tabs).</li>
  <br>
  <p>Some features are functional to showcase key interactions. Where functionality isn’t implemented, you’ll see notes like this, explaining what <em>would</em> happen if the feature were live — giving you a taste of the full experience without the heavy backend.</p>
  <br>
  <p>So click around, explore, and imagine the potential and pass on and ideas or feedback you have. If you see this incon 🗒️, it means there is a note explaining relevant funtionality you can click on.</p>
