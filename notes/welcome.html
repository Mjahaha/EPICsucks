  <h1>Welcome to EPIC Ops Redo</h1>
  <p><strong>EPIC Ops Redo</strong> is a prototype showing a new, streamlined layout.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This high-fidelity version focuses on layout, flow, and interaction â€” not real data or system connections.</p>
  <br>
    <li>Case management from receiving to closure (not creation).</li>
    <li>Home screens: My Work and Dashboard tabs.</li>
  <br>
  <p>Some features work to show key interactions. Where they donâ€™t, notes like this should appear explaining what <em>would</em> happen.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="#" onclick="loadPage('case')">Open a Case</a></h2>
  <br>
  <p>Click around, explore, and share feedback. When you usually see ðŸ“ƒ, it opens a note to explain something about what you are looking at.</p>
